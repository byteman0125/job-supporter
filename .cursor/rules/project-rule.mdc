description:
I have to make code supporter app (tester and supporter) using javascript. and I have to compile this app to exe file that can run on (window) support can run on (ubuntu and windows) we have to use TCP/IP protocal
tester should share their screen to supporter and client should show that screen and can control their mouse and keyboard.
tester should be shared if connection is complete and that process should be hired to tray icon. because interviewer see my entire screen. 
supporter can access to tester through ip. supporter can control when his mouse is on the tester's screen view area.
and supporter can set view mode or control mode. difault is view mode and if supporter set control mode he can control tester's mouse and keyboard.
supporter should grab tester's screen, if he click capture button, image should be savid to image dir.
supporter can copy data via answer area on their screen and he can click send button.
if he send answer, client have to receive and he save he's cache or temp data aire.
if tester click ALT+L, should input One word at a time from temp data. and when input should look like typing by human, you have to provide professional speed.
if click Alt+K, have to input one line at a time like professional programmer speed.
OR, tester can copy any text to clipboard and if he click Alt+C, copied data should be to tester's temp data
When supporter access or send data to tester, tester can sound shortly 
supporter should listen tester's desktop and voice sound. and he can say to tester using mic. on screen, he can select device
tester can send voice to supporter and he can listen supporter's voice. he can set device on setting window. if I click tray icon, he can see setting window.
To reduce risk, the tester app's window should operate in a way that makes it invisible when sharing the screen. only tester can see his window(tester app)
