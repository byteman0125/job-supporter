ANTIVIRUS WHITELIST INSTRUCTIONS
================================

If your antivirus software flags remote-server.exe as a virus, this is a FALSE POSITIVE.

The application is flagged because:
1. It performs screen capture (legitimate remote desktop functionality)
2. It creates network connections (legitimate server functionality)
3. It's a compiled Node.js application (some AVs flag these)

TO WHITELIST THE APPLICATION:

Windows Defender:
1. Open Windows Security
2. Go to Virus & threat protection
3. Click "Manage settings" under Virus & threat protection settings
4. Scroll down to Exclusions and click "Add or remove exclusions"
5. Click "Add an exclusion" > "File"
6. Navigate to and select "remote-server.exe"

Other Antivirus Software:
- Add the entire folder containing remote-server.exe to your antivirus exclusions
- Or add remote-server.exe specifically to the whitelist

VERIFICATION:
- The application is open source and can be inspected
- No malicious code is present
- Only performs legitimate remote desktop server functions
- Uses standard Node.js libraries and FFmpeg

For additional security, you can:
1. Run the application in a sandboxed environment first
2. Check the digital signature (if available)
3. Review the source code at the repository

If you continue to have issues, please contact support or run the application
from the Node.js source files directly using: node main-cli.js
